# The Takeout - Website Distribution

This folder contains the complete frontend representation of **The Takeout** restaurant website.

## 📂 Folder Contents
- **HTML Files**: All pages including the Homepage, Menu, Booking, and Administrative portals.
- **`style.css`**: The premium luxury design system and animations.
- **`app.js`**: Frontend logic, interactive elements, and API integration.
- **`images/`**: High-resolution culinary assets and ambience photography.

## 🚀 How to View
To see the website's design and layout:
1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. Note: Dynamic features (like placing orders or logging in) require the Java backend server to be running. Without the backend, you can still explore the visual design and navigation.

## 🛠️ Exclusions
This folder intentionally excludes the backend source code (Java/Spring Boot), database files, and build configurations to provide a lightweight, UI-only package.
